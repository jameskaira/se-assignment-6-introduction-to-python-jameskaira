2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.
   Step 1: Download and Install Python
Go to the official Python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/.
Download the latest version of Python for Windows.
Run the installer and follow the prompts to install Python. Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python X.X to PATH" before clicking "Install Now".
Step 2: Verify Python Installation
Open Command Prompt.
Type python --version and press Enter. You should see the Python version you installed displayed.
Step 3: Add Python to PATH
If Python wasn't automatically added to your PATH during installation, you'll need to add it manually:

Search for "Environment Variables" in the Start menu and open "Edit the system environment variables".
Click on "Environment Variables...".
Under "System variables", find the variable named "Path" and click "Edit...".
Click "New" and add the path to your Python installation, typically C:\Users\<Your Username>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\PythonXX, replacing <Your Username> with your actual username and XX with your Python version.
Click OK on all dialogs to apply the changes.
Step 4: Install virtualenv
Open Command Prompt.
Type pip install virtualenv and press Enter. This installs the virtualenv package, which allows you to create isolated Python environments.
Step 5: Create a Virtual Environment
Navigate to the directory where you want to create your virtual environment.
Run python -m venv <env_name> to create a new virtual environment, replacing <env_name> with the desired name for your environment.
Step 6: Activate the Virtual Environment
To activate the virtual environment, run .\<env_name>\Scripts\activate in Command Prompt, replacing <env_name> with the name of your environment.
You should see the name of your virtual environment in parentheses at the beginning of the command line, indicating that the environment is active.
Step 7: Verify Virtual Environment Activation
While the virtual environment is active, type python --version again in Command Prompt. It should display the Python version associated with your virtual environment, confirming that the environment is active.

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
  > code>>>>> print(hello, world!")
  <>The print() function is a built-in function in Python used to output data to the standard output device (screen).
  <>The text within double quotes ("Hello, World!") is a string
  <>The parentheses after print indicate that print is a function call


4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
Basic Data Types in Python
int: Integer numbers, whole numbers without decimals.
float: Floating-point numbers, numbers with decimal points.
complex: Complex numbers, numbers with a real part and an imaginary part.
str: Strings, sequences of characters.
bytes, bytearray: Bytes, sequences of integers representing binary data.
bool: Boolean values, True or False.

5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.
   <>Conditional statements evaluate expressions and execute blocks of code based on whether those expressions are true or false.
   eg... score = 80 
if score >= 80:
     print("Excellent")
elif score >= 65:
    print("good")
else :
   print("needs improvement")
<>Loops repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met. Python supports both for and while loops.
 for i in range(10):
 print(i)
6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.
Functions in Python are reusable blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks. They are defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses () which may contain parameters. The code block within every function starts with a colon : and is indented. Functions can optionally return a value using the return statement. Functions are useful for several reasons:

Code Reusability: Writing a function once and calling it multiple times saves time and reduces errors.
Modularity: Functions allow for organizing code into logical units, making it easier to understand and manage.
Scalability: Functions can take parameters, allowing them to handle different inputs and thus scale across various scenarios.

def sum_two_numbers(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2

# Calling the function with two numbers
result = sum_two_numbers(5, 7)
print(result)  # Output: 12

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
   Lists:
Ordered collection of items (can be integers, floats, strings, etc.).
Indexed by integer indices starting from 0.
Mutable, meaning elements can be added, removed, or changed after creation.
Syntax: [item1, item2,..., itemN]
Dictionaries:
Collection of key-value pairs.
Keys are unique and immutable (e.g., strings, numbers), and values can be of any type.
Also mutable; keys and values can be changed or new entries added.
Access elements by their keys, not by index.
Syntax: {key1: value1, key2: value2,...}
code:
# Creating a list of numbers
numbers_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
print("List of Numbers:", numbers_list)

# Adding an element to the list
numbers_list.append(60)
print("\nAfter adding an element to the list:")
print(numbers_list)

# Removing an element from the list
numbers_list.remove(20)
print("\nAfter removing an element from the list:")
print(numbers_list)

# Creating a dictionary with key-value pairs
person_dict = {"name": "John", "age": 28, "city": "New York"}
print("\nDictionary with Key-Value Pairs:", person_dict)

# Changing a value in the dictionary
person_dict["age"] = 29
print("\nAfter changing a value in the dictionary:")
print(person_dict)

# Adding a new key-value pair to the dictionary
person_dict["country"] = "USA"
print("\nAfter adding a new key-value pair to the dictionary:")
print(person_dict)

# Removing a key-value pair from the dictionary
del person_dict["city"]
print("\nAfter removing a key-value pair from the dictionary:")
print(person_dict)



8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
<*>Exception handling in Python allows programs to respond to exceptional circumstances (like runtime errors) gracefully, instead of crashing unexpectedly.
COde:
try:
    # Attempt to open a file
    file = open("non_existent_file.txt", "r")
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
    file.close()
except FileNotFoundError:
    # Handle the specific exception of the file not being found
    print("The file does not exist.")
finally:
    # This block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred
    print("This is the finally block.")



9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.
   <>Concepts of Modules and Packages in Python
Modules
A module in Python is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py added.
Modules are used to organize related code into a single file, making it easier to reuse and manage.
Python comes with a vast standard library of modules covering various functionalities, including mathematics, web services, operating system interfaces, and more.
Packages
A package is a way of organizing related modules into a directory hierarchy. Essentially, it's a directory that contains one or more Python files (modules) and a special file named __init__.py (which can be empty).
Packages allow for better organization and management of large projects by grouping related modules together.
The use of packages helps avoid naming conflicts and makes it easier to navigate through complex projects.
<*>Importing and Using a Module
To use a module in your script, you need to import it using the import statement. After importing, you can access the module's functions, classes, and variables using the dot notation
example code:
import math

# Accessing a constant from the math module
print("The value of pi is", math.pi)

# Using a function from the math module
square_root_of_16 = math.sqrt(16)
print("The square root of 16 is", square_root_of_16)


10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.
    <*>Reading from a File
To read the content of a file and print it to the console, follow these steps:

Open the file using the open() function with the mode set to 'r' (read mode).
Read the content of the file using the read() method.
Close the file using the close() method.
Print the content to the console.
example code:
# Opening the file in read mode
file = open('example.txt', 'r')

# Reading the content of the file
content = file.read()

# Closing the file
file.close()

# Printing the content to the console
print(content)

<>Writing to a File
To write a list of strings to a file, follow these steps:

Open the file using the open() function with the mode set to 'w' (write mode). If the file already exists, it will be overwritten; otherwise, a new file will be created.
Write the content to the file using the write() method. Note that write() expects a string, so if you're working with a list of strings, you'll need to convert it to a single string (e.g., using join()).
Close the file using the close() method.
example code :
# List of strings to write to the file
strings_to_write = ['Hello,', 'world']

# Joining the list of strings into a single string
content_to_write = '\n'.join(strings_to_write)

# Opening the file in write mode
file = open('output.txt', 'w')

# Writing the content to the file
file.write(content_to_write)

# Closing the file
file.close()
